GCN-based approach for drug screening
The uploaded libraries are confidential, and will be updated with following experiments.
The technical details & logic can be found in uploaded files.
For sampling methods, we recommend under-sampling (sub-sampling), due to the fact that the percentage of active compounds is small (the example data_split script is provided for reference); however, other sampling methods may also work well.
For specific drug-screening applications of our script, Y-randomization is recommended for verifying the structural sensivity of GCN upon the training compounds.
